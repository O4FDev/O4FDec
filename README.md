# Hey there ðŸ™Œ
Hey! I'm Luke L. A 15-year-old from Northern Ireland. I'm a programmer who loves all things innovative. I started working on Gamify in July of 2020. 

Gamify is the only effective social media platform aimed at eradicating anxiety once and for all, we do this through crafting AI, implementing interactive maps and drones, along with so much more. (For a more in-depth description check out this brief on pastebin which was given to an Artist in August of 2020 - https://pastebin.com/5byn7hQf)
